phase 1 is research. if today i can leaarn a decent bit about how pgp works thatll be a success

after some research and experimenting itll be programming time
version 1 will be made with python. if all goes well maybe ill make a version 2 in c++


wanna be able to see messages and send messages through simple commands.
